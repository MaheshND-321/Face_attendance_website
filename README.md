 Face recognition systems are useful in many real-life applications. In the proposed system, initially all the students will
 be enrolled by storing their facial images with a unique ID. At the time of attendance,
 real time images will be captured and the faces in those images will be matched with the faces in the pre-trained dataset.
 The Haar cascade algorithm is used for face detection. Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH) algorithm is used for face recognition 
and training the stored dataset, that generates the histogram for stored images and the real time image. To recognize the face,
the difference between histograms of real time image & dataset images is calculated
